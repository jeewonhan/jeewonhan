# Welcome to My Portfolio!

## About Me

Hi, I'm Jeewon, a data scientist and current graduate student at Johns Hopkins Univeristy in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics. My passion lies in collaborative, logic-driven problem-solving and my particular interest is in the convergence of data and entertainment and the artsâ€”it's at this intersection where the fusion of creativity and data generates novel, innovative insights that can inspire transformative changes in how we consume and produce art.

## Featured Project: "Saving Cinema: Designing Movie Theater Showing Schedules"
### Project Overview
As it stands, the current focal point of my portfolio is a project entitled "Saving Cinema: Designing Movie Theater Showing Schedules," which was a semester-long endeavor to predict box office revenues for upcoming movies in order to optimizing movie theater showing schedules.

In recent years, the movie theater industry has faced financial challenges exacerbated by the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decline in box office revenues has been staggering, with a reported 82% decrease from 2018 to 2019. While the industry has shown signs of recovery, the projected box office for 2023 is still well below pre-pandemic levels. To address these challenges, the project's business question is, "How can a movie theater company decide the showing schedule for its theaters?"

### Objective
The primary objective is to build a predictive model using movie metadata to forecast the profitability of showing upcoming films for a movie theater company. Leveraging data from *TMDB (The Movie Database)*, *Box Office Mojo*, and additional sources on revenue streams for movie theaters, the model aims to guide decisions on which movies to show, how often, and for how long.

### Methodology
The project involves careful feature engineering to maximize the predictive power of data, considering variables like cast, budget, director, and genre, to name a few. Other selected techniques include k-means clustering, spectral embedding, Bayesian imputation, and more.
